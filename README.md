WRO Future Engineers Team V^3 Engineering Documentation
====

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the 2023 season.

## Content
* `build` contains documentation about our chassis and material choice
* `electrical` contains schematic diagrams demonstrating the connections between different electromechanical components. It also includes the available datasheets for the aforementioned components and it also has a markdown file explaining the reasoning for each component.
* `models` contains the files used by 3D printers to produce the vehicle elements.
* `photos` contains two folders where one contains the team photos and the other contains the robot photos
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `strategy` contains documentation and diagrams explaining our approach to the problem
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video where driving demonstration exists

## Code Explanation

_This part must be filled by participants with the technical clarifications about the code: which modules the code consists of, how they are related to the electromechanical components of the vehicle, and what is the process to build/compile/upload the code to the vehicleâ€™s controllers.
