## Parts Explanation

| Part Name | Explanation | Image | Datasheet |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1.5V Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery | We are using this battery to power all of our electronics as it is compact and easy to get. They are also efficient for us as they are rechargeable and do not have to be replaced. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/139581102/0919130e-14e3-4f3f-b849-b53199521329) | [Battery Info]("https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/139581102/c22e1f07-a4a4-43c5-a03d-5874437d34b7") |
| 22mm Planetary Gear DC Motor w/ 12V Encoder, 185RPM | We are using this specific motor to drive the robot as it contains a gearbox that can reach a maximum speed of 185rpm. It also includes encoders which can be used to measure the amount that the motor used. This versatility allows this to be the ideal motor for our robot. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/b1ea0b79-4e47-4835-a2d0-d0387937bbf2) | [DC Motor Info](https://cdn.robotshop.com/rbm/a00a7635-653b-4220-aac9-b0c23c5c5e2c/1/1031a402-eb67-4102-8300-9d3d54739abd/3eac6dd4_22pg-2230-en-motor.pdf) |
| CJMCU34725 TCS34725 RGB Light Color Sensor | Using this RGB color sensor allows our robot to sense the blue and orange lines at the corners of the mat. This allows us to keep track of how many laps the robot has completed and indicate when the robot needs to turn. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/11de23ca-59b6-454f-bb24-97d71231661f) | [Color Sensor Info](https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/b/bb/TCS34725_Color_Sensor_user_manual_en.pdf) |
| Arduino Nano | In order to process the information from the sensors and make decisions based on the running code, we are using the Arduino Nano, which is programmed with the Arduino IDE. This board is easy to use, and there are many libraries available and on demand. The board contains 14 digital input/output pins, enabling us to connect a multitude of devices. It also has eight analog pins, of which two are used for I2C communication. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/139581102/8b7d66f1-2f6f-426f-8819-cc5c2578c9bd)| [Arduino Nano Info](https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/ArduinoNanoManual23.pdf) |
| ES08MA Metal Analog Servo | In order to steer our vehicle, we use a servo motor with 1.6 Kilogram-force centimetres of torque and a speed of 0.12 sec/60Â°. Since steering will require a reasonably large amount of torque, this motor provides more than enough for our application. Furthermore, this servo motor can turn quickly, which allows us to make incredibly sharp turns. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/c786181c-acbb-454b-9b61-efc980529729) | [Servo Info](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZU3A84tYS._AC_SL1000_.jpg) |
| GP2Y0A02YK0F IR Range Sensor | The IR sensors provide the necessary information on the distance to the walls at an extremely fast rate. These specific sensors sense distance accurately from 20 to 150cm. We use three of these sensors since we use two to follow the walls and one to detect how close we are to any wall in front of our robot. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/b6f9fde8-1bf3-4b70-9356-bc7b88c42bec) | [IR Sensor Info](https://cdn.robotshop.com/media/d/dem/rb-dem-02/pdf/datasheet-gp2y0a02yk0f.pdf) |
| HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor | In order to detect small distances to any walls on the side of our robot, we are using these ultrasonic sensors since they have a minimum sensing range of 2cm and a maximum range of 400cm. However, these sensors are slower than the IR sensors, so we only use ultrasonic sensors to detect walls on the side of the robot. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/1e8a0d19-53f6-42ea-8886-9a73e8b103d3) | [Ultrasonic Sensor Info](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf) |
| L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver | To effectively power our motors, we are using the L298N motor driver where we are able to control the direction and speed of both motors using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). We also use the 5V output to power our servo motor since the output may vary and our servo has a large input voltage range. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/bab43380-a87a-4e54-83f2-e24c08ec1acd) | [Motor Driver Info](http://www.handsontec.com/dataspecs/L298N%20Motor%20Driver.pdf) |
| L3G4200D Triple Axis Gyro Angular Velocity Sensor Module | We use a gyro angular velocity sensor to determine our vehicle's angular direction and accurately measure the change in angle per turn. To get accurate angle measurements from the gyro, we integrate the yaw angular velocity after calibrating the gyro to determine the robot's angle relative to its starting position.  | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/1ede8942-381b-404f-8901-00fa2bd3f43b) | [Gyro Info](https://www.elecrow.com/download/L3G4200_AN3393.pdf) |
| L7805 Voltage Regulator | Our battery voltage is 12V so we need a voltage regulator to consistently keep the voltage at 5V to power the ELEGOO UNO R3 and the IR sensors. Without this voltage regulator, the ELEGOO UNO R3 may overheat since the internal regulator will get hot and will drain the performance of our robot. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/d3883378-43b8-4f2f-a01d-a3641c594a4e) | [Voltage Regulator Info](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/l78.pdf) |
| PixyCam Pixy 2.1 Robot Vision Image Sensor | Since the ELEGOO UNO R3 does not have enough computing power to process images, we are outsourcing the processing to the Pixy 2.1. This camera is able to provide the microcontroller with the necessary information to plan an appropriate path for the robot to take. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/d2c488d6-f942-47e1-92da-26b894877c1c) | [Pixy 2.1 Info](https://docs.pixycam.com/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:v2:start) |
