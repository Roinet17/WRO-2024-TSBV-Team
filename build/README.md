This directory consists of the different materials used to construct our robot along with the reasoning for choosing our drivetrain.

## Chassis Type & Explanation

Our robot is a four-wheeled vehicle which has a rear-wheel drive with steering in the front. We decided to implement a simple chassis since that would reduce the amount of complexity, and therefore points of failiure in our chassis. In order to keep the drivetrain simple, we made sure not to have the steering mechanism on the same set of wheels as the driving wheels. This meant that we could only have two options for driving which were front-wheel drive with steering in the back or a rear-wheel drive with steering in the front.

## Steering

Our steering mechanism is a four-bar with free spinning wheels mounted on it. The motor will move the four-bar which changes the angle of the wheels which changes the direction the vehicle is travelling in. We decided to use this type of steering since it was simple even though the geometry does not work perfectly, it is still good enough for the purpose of this car.

## Materials

When creating our robot, we wanted to be able to rapidly change our robot is many ways. In order to achieve these goals, we decided to use LEGO technic pieces to construct the majority of our robot. LEGO technic was the perfect choice for us since our robotics centre focuses on LEGO robotics so we have an abundance of LEGO technic pieces. In order to attach the electronic components onto our chassis, we 3d printed mounts for the components.
