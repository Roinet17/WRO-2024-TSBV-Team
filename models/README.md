Models
====

This directory contains all the models used for our robot. Since our robot is made out of LEGO technic pieces, we are going to be 3d printing mounts and adapters for the electronics. Below is a table of our 3d printed parts and what they are used for.

| Gear.stl | To solve the problem of transferring the power from the 6V motors to the LEGO axles, we designed and 3D printed a gear that is mounted on the motor's shaft and meshs with the LEGO differential. We had to create our own gear because the motors have a 3mm D-shaped insert which differs from a plus-shaped LEGO axle. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/b24ff467-16ee-464c-808a-fc4729bf5bb2) |
| Motor Bracket.stl | With motor stability being a crucial part of our drivetrain, we needed to create our own mount to properly secure the motors to our chassis. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/f741008c-79c1-4838-af11-8945955d5e95) |

| Servo Adapter.stl | Similar to the motor adapter, our servo motor's power must also be transferred to LEGO pieces. As a result, we created a matching axle slot, which we tuned by prototyping with different dimensions, and a slot for the servo motor, which we also adjusted by creating multiple iterations. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/78c2afea-d15d-46d4-89fd-f4324e31320f) |
| Servo Mount.stl | Our servo motor needed to be secure in order to have crisp steering and minimal unwanted movement. To achieve this, we modelled a mount for the servo motor that would attach to our chassis and also contain a slot that perfectly fits the servo motor. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/f23be82d-2398-494a-b607-a47742281a4d) |
