Models
====

This directory contains all the models used for our robot. Since our robot is made out of LEGO technic pieces, we are going to be 3d printing mounts and adapters for the electronics. Below is a table of our 3d printed parts and what they are used for.

| Battery Mount.stl | In order to maximize efficiency and minimize the amount of effort while replacing our battery, we designed a casing for our Lithium-ion battery and 3D printed it using Snapmaker's PLA filament. Rather than taping our battery to our chassis, this casing contains LEGO axle inserts that allow us to directly integrate our attachment to the LEGO components of our robot. This flexibility allows for a secure and reliable area for the battery to reside while our robot completes the challenge. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/8f95a1c3-0801-4091-be89-27c0f2f51ecb) |
| Motor Adapter.stl | To solve the problem of transferring the power from the 12V motors to the  LEGO axles, we designed and 3D printed an adapter that allows us to insert a LEGO axle and a motor shaft to connect them. We had to create our own adapter because the motors have a 4mm D-shaped insert which differs from a plus-shaped LEGO axle. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/e534238e-082d-48da-b549-4ca38273b57b) |
| Motor Mount.stl | With motor stability being a crucial part of our drivetrain, we needed to create our own mounts to properly secure the motors to our chassis. Furthermore, the mount allows us to attach a mulititude of different electronic components to it reliably without needing more adapters and LEGO pieces. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/141cfb42-959f-41e4-82d2-7c7fe234f32b) |
| Servo Adapter.stl | Similar to the motor adapter, our servo motor's power must also be transferred to LEGO pieces. As a result, we created a matching axle slot, which we tuned by prototyping with different dimensions, and a slot for the servo motor, which we also adjusted by creating multiple iterations. | ![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/30b39a18-809c-4676-9ff8-7d240d31a4a0) |
| Servo Mount.stl | Our servo motor needed to be secure in order to have crisp steering and minimal unwanted movement. To achieve this, we modelled a mount for the servo motor that would attach to our chassis and also contain a slot that perfectly fits the servo motor. |![image](https://github.com/VedantGithub123/WRO-2023-FE/assets/112735969/3f8a0f49-5e8c-4832-98c1-b5f45d3008f8) |
